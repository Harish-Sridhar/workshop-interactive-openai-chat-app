# Interactive chat app

In this workshop, we will build a front end interactive chat application that record user voice, use open ai to transcribe the audio, then use chat gpt to respond to the request.
We also use hugging face sentiment analysis to detect sentiments.

# Test the setup

Execute the command.

    ./.venv/bin/python frontend/app.py

then go to the url `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

If all works, you should see the interactive chat web app.  
But the app will not work completely.  
Becuase the code in `frontend/app.py` is incomplete.  
Your task is to complete them.  

# Complete the app.

Go to the python program `frontend/app.py`.  
Go through the code, go through the comments. There are three tasks. Complete them.
